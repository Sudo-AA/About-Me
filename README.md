# 👑 The Architect of Systems, Devourer of Bugs 🧠💻🔥

> *"Code not written in blood shall crash in silence."*

Welcome, traveler.

You’ve stumbled upon the repository of a system forged in fire, logic, and caffeine. I build architectures that whisper to the void and return optimized answers. Bugs fear me. Logs obey me. Features manifest at my command.

## 📜 Oaths I Abide By

- 🛑 Never push to `main` without a fight
- 🔍 Bugs shall not survive the first round of testing
- 🧪 Test coverage is sacred
- ⚙️ Every system deserves to evolve—or be destroyed

## ☠️ Current Mission

Rewriting the laws of logic, one stored procedure at a time.  
My recent conquests include:
